# Classification

## Contents
1. Logistic Regression
2. Kmeans (tensorflow)




## Logistic Regression
* Build a classification model
* Estimates an applicant's probability of admission based the scores from 2 exams
* Use sklearn logistic regression
    * Use F1-score
    * Use Grid search Cross Validation
    * Use threshold in hyper tuning


## Kmeans (tensorflow)
* Read local MNIST dataset
* Use TensorFlow built-in KMeans algorithm
   * use kmean++ algorithm to initialize centers
   * use tensorboard to visualization
* Algorithm
   * use Kmeans to cluster MNIST data into 25 clusters
   * use max count to label 25 clusters for classification
