## Contents
1. Logistic Regression
2. Kmeans (tensorflow)
3. SVM (linear + kernel)
4. Gradient Boosting



## Logistic Regression
* Build a classification model using logistic regression to estimates an applicant's probability of admission based the scores from 2 exams
* Use sklearn logistic regression
    * Use F1-score
    * Use Grid search Cross Validation
    * Use threshold in hyper tuning


## Kmeans (tensorflow)
* Use TensorFlow built-in KMeans algorithm to classify handwritten digits (MNIST)
   * Load local MNIST dataset
   * use kmean++ algorithm to initialize centers
   * use tensorboard to visualization
* Algorithm
   * use Kmeans to cluster MNIST data into 25 clusters
   * use max count to label 25 clusters for classification 



## Support Vector Machine
* Build a classification model using SVM 
* Data: coursera machine learning week 6
* SVM model
   * Linear model
   * Kernel model


## Gradient Boosting
* Build a classification model using Gradient Boosting 
* Feature engineering
* Gradient boosting default model
* Gradient boosting hyper tuning (CV grid search)
